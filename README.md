# PacMan
A Pac_Man-styled game using a randomized grid world environment and Q_learning method.
The files contain both the agent and the environment which is displayed using the pygame library. 
The good bird is displayed with yellow, the bad one with red, the foods with green and the walls with grey rectangle.

In this game, a good bird flies around eating food based on the Q_table while the bad bird tries to hunt it down using random steps. 
The environment contains walls to make it more exciting, also the learning is much harder and takes more time.

The project was built as a practice and to have fun. 

To run the game simply copy the files and install the used libraries.

Future updates: It could be modified to a double agent environment.
